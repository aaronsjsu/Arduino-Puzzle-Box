# Arduino Puzzle Box

Recently I set out on a project to make a puzzle box for an escape room. It took some time, but I finally finished the project. I've included the source code, images, and the build details so that others might be able to learn from it.

## How It Works

I created this puzzle box to unlock once the user has completed certain objectives. On the outside of the box are 3 dials and 3 buttons. The user has to move the dials to a certain direction, and push some combinations of the buttons to solve a challenge. The box will unlock once three challenges are solved. The solutions to each challenge are meant to be discovered elsewhere in the escape room. The lcd display provides feedback as to the progress of the challenges.
